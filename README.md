# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Deliverable 1
  Pewlett-Hackard is a large tech company that is facing a retirement cliff due to a large number of their employees entering their final years before retirement. To prepare for the high number employees retiring in the near future, senior management has tasked me with scouring employee records to identify individuals that will be retiring soon. We defined employees eligible for retirment as those born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. We then used that criteria to determine how many vacancies there will be in each position in the company. 
  
### Deliverable 2  
   Pewlett-Hackard has also expressed interest in developing an Employee Mentorship Program to help future-proof the company by easing transition between retiring employees and new employees that will be replacing them. To accomplish this, we identified employees eligible to become mentors as those born between January 1, 195 and December 31, 1965. These individuals are likely to have many years of experience working for the company and will be retiring within the next few years. Armed with information provided through our analysis in Deliverables 1 and 2, we will have a good estimate of upcoming vacancies and individuals that can help us expedite new employee training to fill the vacancies.
